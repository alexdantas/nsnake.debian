If you try to run nSnake with parameters that don't start with '-', they are
completely ignored.
(Fix probably at getopt_long at arguments.c)

When the fruit is at the bottom of the screen and the snake tries to eat it
on the borderless mode teleporting from above, it doesn't get eaten - the
snake goes through it.
The same when the fruit is at the top left and the snake goes through the
right.
(Fix at collision detection)

When the player holds a directional key, the snake keeps going for a while.
Maybe holding the key fills the input buffer or something.
